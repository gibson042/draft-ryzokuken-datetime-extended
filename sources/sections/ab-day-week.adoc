== Day of the Week

The following is a sample C subroutine loosely based on Zeller's
Congruence <<ZELLER>> which may be used to obtain the day of the week
for dates on or after 0000-03-01:

[source,c]
--
char *day_of_week(int day, int month, int year)
{
    int cent;
    char *dayofweek[] = {
        "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
        "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"
    };

    /* adjust months so February is the last one */
    month -= 2;
    if (month < 1) {
        month += 12;
        --year;
    }
    /* split by century */
    cent = year / 100;
    year %= 100;
    return (dayofweek[((26 * month - 2) / 10 + day + year
                    + year / 4 + cent / 4 + 5 * cent) % 7]);
