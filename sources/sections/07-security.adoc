== Security Considerations

Since the local time zone of a site may be useful for determining a
time when systems are less likely to be monitored and might be more
susceptible to a security probe, some sites may wish to emit times in
UTC only. Others might consider this to be loss of useful
functionality at the hands of paranoia.
