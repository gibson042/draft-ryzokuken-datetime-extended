Gregorian calendar. For any dates and times in a different calendar
system the ID of the calendar that they are expected to be in is
required to be included which the implementation would then project
them to. In the absence of a calendar ID, the Proleptic Gregorian
calendar system is assumed.</t>

interpretation will not cause a protocol or processing failure
(e.g. if used only for logging or tracing purposes).</t>

<t anchor="_4c416fe2-a8c4-47bd-bb83-4ab13aad930e">It is possible that a program using two digit years will
represent years after 1999 as three digits.  This occurs if the
program simply subtracts 1900 from the year and doesn't check
the number of digits.  Programs wishing to robustly deal with
dates generated by such broken software may add 1900 to three
digit years.</t>

<t anchor="_ac068294-1b59-4cad-80a5-8e7c073f3ce8">Because the daylight saving rules for local time zones are so
convoluted and can change based on local law at unpredictable times,
true interoperability is best achieved by using Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC).  This specification does not cater to local time zone
rules.</t>
</section>
      <section anchor="_local_offsets"><name>Local Offsets</name><t anchor="_048409d9-6e41-4cf4-9902-ca062645d9c0">The offset between local time and UTC is often useful information.
For example, in electronic mail (RFC2822, <relref target="IMAIL-UPDATE" section="" relative=""></relref>) the local
offset provides a useful heuristic to determine the probability of a
prompt response.  Attempts to label local offsets with alphabetic
strings have resulted in poor interoperability in the past. <xref target="IMAIL"></xref>,
<relref target="HOST-REQ" section="" relative=""></relref>. As a result, RFC2822 <relref target="IMAIL-UPDATE" section="" relative=""></relref> has made numeric
offsets mandatory.</t>
<t anchor="_76b7239f-4890-4ff8-854f-996373d09195">Numeric offsets are calculated as "local time minus UTC".  So the
equivalent time in UTC can be determined by subtracting the offset
from the local time.  For example, 18:50:00-04:00 is the same time as
22:50:00Z.  (This example shows negative offsets handled by adding
the absolute value of the offset.)</t>
<aside anchor="_1d6d9e62-3b32-43f0-91f2-2ab83bb207c4"><t>NOTE: Following ISO 8601, numeric offsets represent only time
zones that differ from UTC by an integral number of minutes.
However, many historical time zones differ from UTC by a non-
integral number of minutes.  To represent such historical time
stamps exactly, applications must convert them to a representable
time zone.</t></aside></section>

<t anchor="_c9c9f323-eaad-4d6f-8f2c-eabcc6990329">If the time in UTC is known, but the offset to local time is unknown,
this can be represented with an offset of "-00:00".  This differs
semantically from an offset of "Z" or "+00:00", which imply that UTC
is the preferred reference point for the specified time.  RFC2822
<relref target="IMAIL-UPDATE" section="" relative=""></relref> describes a similar convention for email.</t>

      <section anchor="_unqualified_local_time"><name>Unqualified Local Time</name><t anchor="_8d10bfa7-85e8-4116-a4e9-b5a55c5af621">A number of devices currently connected to the Internet run their
internal clocks in local time and are unaware of UTC.  While the
Internet does have a tradition of accepting reality when creating
specifications, this should not be done at the expense of
interoperability.  Since interpretation of an unqualified local time
zone will fail in approximately 23/24 of the globe, the
interoperability problems of unqualified local time are deemed
unacceptable for the Internet.  Systems that are configured with a
local time, are unaware of the corresponding UTC offset, and depend
on time synchronization with other Internet systems, MUST use a
mechanism that ensures correct synchronization with UTC.  Some
suitable mechanisms are:</t>

<t anchor="_3b30c319-08c5-44df-9ff1-ee44d19df00d">If date and time components are ordered from least precise to most
precise, then a useful property is achieved. Assuming that the time
zones of the dates and times are the same (e.g., all in UTC),
expressed using the same string (e.g., all "Z" or all "+00:00"), and
all times have the same number of fractional second digits, then the
date and time strings may be sorted as strings (e.g., using the
<tt>strcmp()</tt> function in C) and a time-ordered sequence will result. The
presence of optional punctuation would violate this characteristic.</t>

      <section anchor="_human_readability"><name>Human Readability</name><t anchor="_073f698e-dfac-4eea-8263-6af54e835bb6">Human readability has proved to be a valuable feature of Internet
protocols. Human readable protocols greatly reduce the costs of
debugging since telnet often suffices as a test client and network
analyzers need not be modified with knowledge of the protocol. On
the other hand, human readability sometimes results in
interoperability problems. For example, the date format "10/11/1996"
is completely unsuitable for global interchange because it is
interpreted differently in different countries. In addition, the
date format in <xref target="IMAIL"></xref> has resulted in interoperability problems when
people assumed any text string was permitted and translated the three
letter abbreviations to other languages or substituted date formats
which were easier to generate (e.g. the format used by the C function
<tt>ctime</tt>). For this reason, a balance must be struck between human
readability and interoperability.</t>
<t anchor="_a852e1c5-796a-48ff-9aae-85029d2ae2eb">Because no date and time format is readable according to the
conventions of all countries, Internet clients SHOULD be prepared to
transform dates into a display format suitable for the locality.
This may include translating UTC to local time.</t></section>

interoperability problems. This is because rarely used options are
less likely to be used in alpha or beta testing, so bugs in parsing
are less likely to be discovered. Rarely used options should be made
mandatory or omitted for the sake of interoperability whenever
possible.</t>
<t anchor="_fdb14b25-3148-4dfc-8a7e-497ebb301606">The format defined below includes only one rarely used option:
fractions of a second. It is expected that this will be used only by

<t anchor="_a6e8c88e-3fcf-447f-87c9-84e8fe433a5e">If a date/time format includes redundant information, that introduces
the possibility that the redundant information will not correlate.
For example, including the day of the week in a date/time format
introduces the possibility that the day of week is incorrect but the
date is correct, or vice versa. Since it is not difficult to compute
the day of week from a date (see <xref target="annexB"></xref>), the day of week should
not be included in a date/time format.</t>

shifted by the zone offset (so it happens at the same instant around
the globe).</t>
<t anchor="_43c648e4-ffca-436b-a12b-b107cdf80466">Leap seconds cannot be predicted far into the future. The
International Earth Rotation Service publishes bulletins (IERS) that
announce leap seconds with a few weeks' warning. Applications should
not generate timestamps involving inserted leap seconds until after
the leap seconds are announced.</t>
<t anchor="_540de909-cc26-4f34-a1ec-71148eb81001">Although ISO 8601 permits the hour to be "24", this profile of ISO
8601 only allows values between "00" and "23" for the hour in order
to reduce confusion.</t></section>

susceptible to a security probe, some sites may wish to emit times in

      <t anchor="_1712b4e4-d666-4e6c-9442-f7fe90f04ea6">This information is based on the 1988 version of ISO 8601.  There may
be some changes in the 2000 revision.</t>
      <t anchor="_85ac786b-917a-4a92-9444-fbdc177c8d07">ISO 8601 does not specify a formal grammar for the date and time
formats it defines.  The following is an attempt to create a formal
grammar from ISO 8601.  This is informational only and may contain
errors.  ISO 8601 remains the authoritative reference.</t>
      <t anchor="_f5086fa1-5964-4949-b1b1-0c4ff1246ab1">Note that due to ambiguities in ISO 8601, some interpretations had to
be made.  First, ISO 8601 is not clear if mixtures of basic and
extended format are permissible.  This grammar permits mixtures. ISO
8601 is not clear on whether an hour of 24 is permissible only if
minutes and seconds are 0.  This assumes that an hour of 24 is
permissible in any context.  Restrictions on date-mday in section <xref target="restrictions"></xref>
apply.  ISO 8601 states that the "T" may be omitted under some
circumstances.  This grammar requires the "T" to avoid ambiguity.
ISO 8601 also requires (in section 5.3.1.3) that a decimal fraction
be proceeded by a "0" if less than unity.  Annex B.2 of ISO 8601
gives examples where the decimal fractions are not preceded by a "0".
This grammar assumes section 5.3.1.3 is correct and that Annex B.2 is
in error.</t>
