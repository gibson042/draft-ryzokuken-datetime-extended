    <section anchor="intro"><name>Introduction</name><t anchor="_69a5301b-32ef-4113-94a5-ea742ca692c4">Date and time formats cause a lot of confusion and interoperability
problems on the Internet. This document addresses many of the
problems encountered and makes recommendations to improve consistency
and interoperability when representing and using date and time in
Internet protocols.</t>
<t anchor="_6b7b920e-314a-483a-81c2-0a562e2cd880">This document includes an extension to an Internet profile of the
<relref target="ISO8601" section="" relative=""></relref> standard for representation of dates and times using the
proleptic Gregorian calendar alongside any additional information. Any
dates and times that are required to be handled in a different calendar
system need to include the ID of the calendar which can be handle by
the implementations approximately. In the absence of a calendar ID, the
proleptic Gregorian calendar system is assumed.</t>
<t anchor="_73c6be69-66cb-4555-88d3-b6a422c8b84b">There are many ways in which date and time values might appear in
Internet protocols:  this document focuses on just one common usage,
viz. timestamps for Internet protocol events.  This limited

<t anchor="_3e294f25-a7f6-4a8e-8e63-50624f1f75c0">Because the daylight saving rules for local time zones are so
convoluted and can change based on local law at unpredictable times,
true interoperability is best achieved by using Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC). This specification by itself does not cater to local
time zone rules. However, certain implementations may be expected to.
For these situations, a timestamp may additionally include a local time
zone that the implementations can take into account.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="_local_offsets"><name>Local Offsets</name><t anchor="_aea35bad-c18e-47db-b0f7-3a79c47a952b">The offset between local time and UTC is often useful information.
For example, in electronic mail (RFC2822, <relref target="RFC2822" section="" relative=""></relref>) the local
offset provides a useful heuristic to determine the probability of a
prompt response. Attempts to label local offsets with alphabetic
strings have resulted in poor interoperability in the past <relref target="RFC1123" section="" relative=""></relref>.
As a result, RFC2822 <relref target="RFC2822" section="" relative=""></relref> has made numeric offsets mandatory.</t>
<t anchor="_40adc955-4115-401e-bc7f-e35e4944d2e9">Numeric offsets are calculated as "local time minus UTC".  So the
equivalent time in UTC can be determined by subtracting the offset
from the local time. For example, <tt>18:50:00-04:00</tt> is the same time as
<tt>22:50:00Z</tt>. (This example shows negative offsets handled by adding
the absolute value of the offset.)</t>
<t anchor="_8f9e5496-b526-4c73-b072-250c631ccf69">Numeric offsets may differ from UTC by any number of seconds, or even a
fraction of seconds. This can be easily represented by including an
optional seconds value in the offset, which may further optionally include
a fraction of seconds behind a decimal point, for example <tt>+12:34:56.789</tt>.
This is especially useful in the case of certain historical time zones.</t></section>
<section anchor="_unknown_local_offset_convention"><name>Unknown Local Offset Convention</name>

<t anchor="_05d6b24f-dd69-4eff-ae1b-e5cb265ff4ae">If the time in UTC is known, but the offset to local time is unknown,
this can be represented with an offset of "-00:00". This differs
semantically from an offset of "Z" or "+00:00", which imply that UTC
is the preferred reference point for the specified time. RFC2822
<relref target="RFC2822" section="" relative=""></relref> describes a similar convention for email.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="_unqualified_local_time"><name>Unqualified Local Time</name><t anchor="_85ddd2f4-bd65-48ad-a70d-2cdfac608d94">A number of devices currently connected to the Internet run their
internal clocks in local time and are unaware of UTC. While the
Internet does have a tradition of accepting reality when creating
specifications, this should not be done at the expense of
interoperability. Since interpretation of an unqualified local time
zone will fail in approximately 23/24 of the globe, the
interoperability problems of unqualified local time are deemed
unacceptable for the Internet. Systems that are configured with a
local time, are unaware of the corresponding UTC offset, and depend
on time synchronization with other Internet systems, MUST use a
mechanism that ensures correct synchronization with UTC. Some
suitable mechanisms are:</t>
<ul anchor="_5360bb42-3481-45f7-8016-5a66510f040c">
<li>
<t anchor="_a374275d-e8ce-49ee-82bb-6e37e5e8de97">Use Network Time Protocol <relref target="RFC1305" section="" relative=""></relref> to obtain the time in UTC.</t>

    <section anchor="date-time-format"><name>Date and Time format</name><t anchor="_efb315c6-60fd-4f54-91ba-cec4d9293ade">This section discusses desirable qualities of date and time formats
and defines a format that extends the profile of ISO 8601 for use in
Internet protocols.</t>
<section anchor="_ordering"><name>Ordering</name>

<t anchor="_5784ec10-bef2-4261-9df5-565fbb5f5c52">If date and time components are ordered from least precise to most
precise, then a useful property is achieved. Assuming that the time
zones of the dates and times are the same (e.g., all in UTC),
expressed using the same string (e.g., all "Z" or all "+00:00"), all
times have the same number of fractional second digits, and they all
have the same suffix (or none), then the date and time strings may be
sorted as strings (e.g., using the <tt>strcmp()</tt> function in C) and a
time-ordered sequence will result. The presence of optional punctuation
would violate this characteristic.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="_human_readability"><name>Human Readability</name><t anchor="_7d4a5f70-0733-40a6-806a-7bc385c1071e">Human readability has proved to be a valuable feature of Internet
protocols. Human readable protocols greatly reduce the costs of
debugging since telnet often suffices as a test client and network
analyzers need not be modified with knowledge of the protocol. On
the other hand, human readability sometimes results in
interoperability problems. For example, the date format "10/11/1996"
is completely unsuitable for global interchange because it is
interpreted differently in different countries. In addition, the
date format in (RFC822) has resulted in interoperability problems when
people assumed any text string was permitted and translated the three
letter abbreviations to other languages or substituted date formats
which were easier to generate (e.g. the format used by the C function
<tt>ctime</tt>). For this reason, a balance must be struck between human
readability and interoperability.</t>
<t anchor="_43afa26d-805f-4b12-8087-1d0f23ffa0d8">Because no date and time format is readable according to the
conventions of all countries, Internet clients SHOULD be prepared to
transform dates into a display format suitable for the locality.
This may include translating UTC to local time as well as converting
from the Gregorian calendar to the viewer's preferred calendar.</t></section>
<section anchor="_rarely_used_options"><name>Rarely Used Options</name>

<t anchor="_1dbc2825-863a-4527-bb2d-74b2e1333cf3">A format which includes rarely used options is likely to cause
interoperability problems. This is because rarely used options are
less likely to be used in alpha or beta testing, so bugs in parsing
are less likely to be discovered. Rarely used options should be made
mandatory or omitted for the sake of interoperability whenever
possible.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="_redundant_information"><name>Redundant Information</name>

<t anchor="_bfdb64f7-02b0-49f7-be75-e9c50fb08998">If a date/time format includes redundant information, that introduces
the possibility that the redundant information will not correlate.
For example, including the day of the week in a date/time format
introduces the possibility that the day of week is incorrect but the
date is correct, or vice versa. Since it is not difficult to compute
the day of week from a date (see <xref target="annexA"></xref>), the day of week should
not be included in a date/time format.</t>

<relref target="ISO8601" section="" relative=""></relref> is quite complex in an attempt to provide multiple

somewhat different requirements and simplicity has proved to be an
important characteristic. In addition, Internet protocols usually need
complete specification of data in order to achieve true interoperability.
Therefore, the complete grammar for ISO 8601 is deemed too complex for
most Internet protocols.</t>
